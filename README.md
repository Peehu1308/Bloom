BloomWatch

An Earth Observation Platform for Monitoring Global Blooming Phenology
NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 – Top 15 Project

🚀 Overview

BloomWatch is a web-based platform that leverages NASA Earth observation data, satellite imagery, and intelligent data analytics to monitor, detect, and visualize blooming (flowering) events and vegetation phenology around the world. This tool helps researchers, environmentalists, and agricultural planners understand how ecosystems respond to environmental changes over space and time.

🧠 Motivation

Plant blooming is a crucial ecological indicator — it reflects:

seasonal changes

biodiversity health

effects of climate variability on plant life

Understanding and tracking these patterns at a global scale provides critical insights into ecological resilience and informs environmental policy. BloomWatch was developed to transform raw satellite data into actionable, interactive insights for users across disciplines.
